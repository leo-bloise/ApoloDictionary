# 📝 Apolo Dictionary
Apolo Dictionary is a simple and fast dictionary application that allows you to search for words and their meanings. It is built using C# and the System.CommandLine library for CLI arguments and options parsing. It also uses webscraping to fetch definitions from the web.

## 🌐 Current Web Scraping Sources
- [Dictionary Cambridge](https://dictionary.cambridge.org)]

The project is not complete and I'm going to implement the following features:
- [ ] Support for multiple words instead of only one.
- [ ] Get all the definitions from Dictionary Cambridge instead of only the first one.
- [ ] Create Release version of the project.
